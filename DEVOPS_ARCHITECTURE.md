# 🏗️ DevOps Multi-Environment Architecture for 3MTT Chatbot

## 📋 Environment Strategy Overview

### **Environment Purposes**
- **Development (DEV)**: Developer workstations + shared dev environment
- **Staging (STG)**: Production-like testing environment
- **Production (PROD)**: Live user-facing environment

### **Data Flow**
```
Developer → DEV → STG → PROD
    ↓        ↓     ↓      ↓
  Local    Shared  Pre-   Live
  Testing  Testing Prod   Users
```

## 🚀 **Deployment Strategy**

### **Deployment Pipeline**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Code Commit] --> B[CI Tests]
    B --> C[Build Image]
    C --> D[Deploy to DEV]
    D --> E[Integration Tests]
    E --> F[Deploy to STG]
    F --> G[UAT Testing]
    G --> H[Deploy to PROD]
    H --> I[Health Checks]
```

### **Promotion Criteria**
- **DEV → STG**: All unit tests pass, code review approved
- **STG → PROD**: UAT passed, performance tests OK, security scan clean

### **Rollback Strategy**
- **Blue-Green Deployment** for zero-downtime
- **Database migrations** with rollback scripts
- **Feature flags** for quick disable
- **Automated rollback** on health check failures

---

## 📈 **Monitoring & Observability**

### **Development**
- Basic application logs
- Simple health checks
- Local debugging tools

### **Staging**
- Full production monitoring stack
- Performance profiling
- Load testing metrics
- Security scanning results

### **Production**
- 24/7 monitoring with alerts
- APM (Application Performance Monitoring)
- Business metrics dashboard
- Incident response automation

---

## 🔄 **CI/CD Pipeline Design**

### **Continuous Integration**
```yaml
Triggers:
  - Pull Request: Run tests, security scan
  - Merge to main: Deploy to DEV
  - Tag release: Deploy to STG
  - Manual approval: Deploy to PROD

Quality Gates:
  - Unit tests: 90% coverage
  - Integration tests: All pass
  - Security scan: No high/critical issues
  - Performance tests: <2s response time
```

### **Continuous Deployment**
```yaml

## 🚨 **Incident Response**

### **Severity Levels**
- **P1 (Critical)**: Production down, data loss
- **P2 (High)**: Major feature broken, performance degraded
- **P3 (Medium)**: Minor feature issues
- **P4 (Low)**: Cosmetic issues, enhancement requests

### **Response Times**
- **P1**: 15 minutes acknowledgment, 1 hour resolution
- **P2**: 1 hour acknowledgment, 4 hours resolution

- **P4**: 24 hours acknowledgment, next sprint

### **Escalation Path**
```
Alert → On-call Engineer → DevOps Lead → Engineering Manager → CTO
```
