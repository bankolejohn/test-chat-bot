## Training & Knowledge Base

### Knowledge Base Management
Access the knowledge base editor at `/admin/knowledge` to:
- View and edit the current knowledge base
- Test knowledge search functionality
- Add new information and topics

### Training the AI
1. **Automatic Learning**: The AI learns from user interactions and feedback
2. **Manual Training**: Run the training script to analyze performance:
   ```bash
   python train_chatbot.py
   ```
3. **Feedback Collection**: Users can rate responses with üëç/üëé buttons
4. **Analytics**: Monitor performance at `/admin/analytics`

### Adding Knowledge
To add new knowledge to your chatbot:

1. **Edit knowledge_base.json** directly or use the admin interface
2. **Add training examples** in training_data.json
3. **Structure your knowledge** in categories like:
   ```json
   {
     "new_topic": {
       "overview": "Description of the topic",
       "details": {
         "subtopic1": "Detailed information",
         "subtopic2": "More details"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
